 The National Three Peaks Challenge 
 involves climbing the three highest peaks of Scotland, England and Wales, often within 24 hours.

The total walking distance is 23 miles (37km) and the total ascent is 3064 metres (10,052ft) - twice the ascent of the Yorkshire Three Peaks, over a similar total walking distance. The total driving distance is 462 miles. 

You can take part in the Challenge in two ways — as a self-organised group, or a professionally organised event. Self-organised events can be the cheapest way to take part, while many groups will benefit from the assistance provided by professional mountain 


 Self-organised groups can optionally register their challenge, to receive certificates and guidance on organising a safe and responsible challenge.
The three mountains are:

    Snowdon, in Wales (1085m)
    Scafell Pike, in England (978m)
    Ben Nevis, in Scotland (1345m)

A popular misconception is that the three mountains that form the challenge are the three tallest on the British mainland. Rather, they are the tallest mountains within each representative country: Scafell Pike is the tallest in England; Snowdon, the tallest in Wales and Ben Nevis the tallest in Scotland — over one hundred peaks in Scotland are higher than Scafell Pike, and 56 higher than Snowdon.
